            averaging 21.1 points per game his first season. The Spurs were able to pick Duncan (the first senior to be selected
            first overall since Larry Johnson) due to the fact that they were coming off a 20-62 season due to a David Robinson injury.

            In his rookie season with the Orlando Magic, O'Neal, also known as "Shaq," finished in the Top 10 in scoring, rebounding, blocks
            and shooting percentage. A notoriously bad free-throw shooter, O'Neal focused on trying to get more of his points on the power slam,
            and hearty NBA centers quickly learned to try to foul O'Neal rather than give him an easy shot. O'Neal became the first player in
            NBA history to be named Player of the Week in his first week in the league.
